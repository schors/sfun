Implementation of some mathematical functions to within 8 decimal places to the MACRO-11
========================================================================================

Library is written in MACRO-11 assembly language for the PDP-11 with macros. Use the most rapid and simple algorithms. 
All constants are selected to calculate with precision eight decimal places. All functions checked by Bradis tables and 
calculation of such functions with greater accuracy on a computer's performance.

Requirements
------------

* PDP-11 computer. This library was tested on PDP-11/34 clone - Russian DVK2. 
* PDP-11 floating point CPU extension, or them software emulation

Functions
---------

* square root
* tan
* atan
* cos
* sin
* asin
* abs

Addition
--------

VCOPY.COM - Microsoft DOS program to copy files from FAT32 to a 5" floppy disk with a RT-11 file system. 
Supports only physically compatible discs (MY). Author of the program is unknown.
